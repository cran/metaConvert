\item{n_cov_ancova}{number of covariates in the ANCOVA model.}

\item{n_exp}{number of participants in the experimental/exposed group.}

\item{n_nexp}{number of participants in the non-experimental/non-exposed group.}

\item{smd_to_cor}{formula used to convert the adjusted \code{cohen_d} value into a coefficient correlation (see details).}

\description{
Convert means and adjusted pooled standard deviation of two independent groups obtained from an ANCOVA model into several effect size measures
}
\details{
This function converts the adjusted pooled standard deviations of two independent groups
into a crude pooled standard deviation.
and then relies on the calculations of the \code{\link{es_from_ancova_means_sd_pooled_crude}()} function.

\strong{To convert the adjusted pooled SD into a crude pooled SD} (table 12.3 in Cooper):
\deqn{mean\_sd\_pooled =  \frac{ancova\_mean\_sd\_pooled}{\sqrt{1 - cov\_outcome\_r^2}}}

Calculations of the \code{\link{es_from_ancova_means_sd_pooled_crude}()} are then applied.
