\description{
Convert pre-post means of two independent groups into various effect size measures
}
\details{
This function converts pre-post means of two independent groups into a Cohen's d (D) and Hedges' g (G).
Odds ratio (OR) and correlation coefficients (R/Z) are then converted from the Cohen's d.

\strong{Two approaches can be used to compute the Cohen's d.}

In these two approaches, the standard deviation of the difference within each group first needs to be obtained:
\deqn{adj\_exp = 2*r\_pre\_post\_exp*mean\_pre\_sd\_exp*mean\_sd\_exp}
\deqn{sd\_change\_exp = \sqrt{mean\_pre\_sd\_exp^2 + mean\_sd\_exp^2 - adj\_exp}}
\deqn{adj\_nexp = 2*r\_pre\_post\_nexp*mean\_pre\_sd\_nexp*mean\_sd\_nexp}
\deqn{sd\_change\_nexp = \sqrt{mean\_pre\_sd\_nexp^2 + mean\_sd\_nexp^2 - adj\_nexp}}
\enumerate{
\item In the approach described by Bonett (\code{pre_post_to_smd = "bonett"}), one Cohen's d per group is obtained by
standardizing the pre-post mean difference by the standard deviation at baseline (Bonett, 2008):
\deqn{cohen\_d\_exp = \frac{mean\_pre\_exp - mean\_exp}{mean\_pre\_sd\_exp}}
\deqn{cohen\_d\_nexp = \frac{mean\_pre\_nexp - mean\_nexp}{mean\_pre\_sd\_nexp}}
\deqn{cohen\_d\_se\_exp = \sqrt{\frac{sd\_change\_exp^2}{mean\_pre\_sd\_exp^2 * (n\_exp - 1) + g\_exp^2 / (2 * (n\_exp - 1))}}}
\deqn{cohen\_d\_se\_nexp = \sqrt{\frac{sd\_change\_nexp^2}{mean\_pre\_sd\_nexp^2 * (n\_nexp - 1) + g\_nexp^2 / (2 * (n\_nexp - 1))}}}
\item In the approach described by Cooper (\code{pre_post_to_smd = "cooper"}), the following formulas are used:
\deqn{cohen\_d\_exp = \frac{mean\_pre\_exp - mean\_exp}{sd\_change\_exp} * \sqrt{2 * (1 - r\_pre\_post\_exp)}}
\deqn{cohen\_d\_nexp = \frac{mean\_pre\_nexp - mean\_nexp}{sd\_change\_nexp} * \sqrt{2 * (1 - r\_pre\_post\_nexp)}}
\deqn{cohen\_d\_se\_exp = \frac{2 * (1 - r\_pre\_post\_exp)}{n\_exp} + \frac{cohen\_d\_exp^2}{2 * n\_exp}}
\deqn{cohen\_d\_se\_nexp = \frac{2 * (1 - r\_pre\_post\_nexp)}{n\_nexp} + \frac{cohen\_d\_nexp^2}{2 * n\_nexp}}
}

Last, the Cohen's d reflecting the within-group change from baseline to follow-up are combined into one Cohen's d:
\deqn{cohen\_d = d\_exp - d\_nexp}
\deqn{cohen\_d\_se = \sqrt{cohen\_d\_se\_exp^2 + cohen\_d\_se\_nexp^2}}

\strong{To estimate other effect size measures},
calculations of the \code{\link{es_from_cohen_d}()} are applied.
