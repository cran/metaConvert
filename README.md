## Important

If you are not familiar with R, you can access the core features of this
package on your web browser on its dedicated website
[(https://metaConvert.org/)](https://metaConvert.org/).

## Introduction

This package automatically estimates 11 effect size measures from a
well-formatted dataset. Various other functions can help, for example,
removing dependency between several effect sizes, or identifying
differences between two datasets.

This package is mainly designed to assist in conducting a systematic
review with a meta-analysis but can be useful to any researcher
interested in estimating an effect size.
